They have the air of hippies travellers and not of techno freaks,     both Boards of Canada, with their smile, rucksack and their wool bonnet...     There one does not imagine to hold the authors of a crystal electronic coffee-table     book pure, published under a double signature one cannot connected any more:     Skam and Warp, respectively pointed label of Manchester and mythical head     office of the electronica made in Sheffield.</tt></b>   <p><b><tt>This album, " Music Has the Right to Children ", resembles itssmall pocket. The image of a family or a group of friends, obviously onthe stones of a castle in ruin. Naive image like the universes of the "magic Horse-gear " and the " Animals of the World ". Banal. Happy. Butthis image is embedded of light green blue, as under the effect of a flyingsaucer in phase of landing. And then there are these smooth faces likea pumice. Worrying. Faces the human ones zombifi&eacute;s. What hides MichaelSandison and Markus Eoin by this image of disturbed innocence? Both Scottish- we confused the voice in the interview - seem to do only one, the firsta little more talkative than the second with his accent to strike the earlobe...</tt></b><p><b><tt>VIRGIN MEGAWEB: One does not see well which you are, which youdid, you are Scottish, not?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOARDS OF CANADA : It is right, we live in Scotland, in the countrysidea few kilometres from Edinburgh...</tt></b><p><b><tt>Apparently, you were never related to a scene or a particularstyle of music? You seem isolated enough?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, it has been only for two years that we started tocontact other musicians, in particular of the artists of Skam Records andfrom Warp. In fact, that made for a very long time that the group saw,between friends. That goes up at the beginning of the Eighties, when wewere young...</tt></b><p><b><tt>You started adolescent to actually make music?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yeah. We had both ten years old, something like that. Welearned how to still play of the younger instruments, then very early wehandled recordings, cassettes and tapes, making joinings. We started towrite and to play in a more serious way around 1987, ten years ago, inthe format who is ours.</tt></b><p><b><tt>You two only?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - No, with other musicians, within the framework of a truegroup much broader. But, a few years ago, after having played of the guitarsand from the acoustic battery, we returned to a form more frankly electronic...</tt></b><p><b><tt>Actually, when you started to play, it was rather like a setof teenagers, testing with recordings of films and instruments. You didnot seek to make career...</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - One had fun with sounds which we liked, from where thatthey come. Our course is a little complicated. Initially, one tested withoutputting questions, with the means of the edge, then one worked much withmusicians and truths instruments, one complexed our music. Five years ago,it sounded nearer to the experimental rock, with the vocal ones on theoccasion... There was nevertheless no badly electronics, already one samplaitour own instruments. Then we returned to a spirit closer to our beginnings,simple and instinctive, with the only difference which we use from nowon digital too, and which it is thus much easier to have fun and to obtainwhat one wishes...</tt></b><p><b><tt>You feel close to all the generation of the home studio?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - In a sense, perhaps. Our step of beginning with our oldapparatus to record be as a version poor of it that some other have makethereafter with the home studio. But if one were near to the spirit ofgeneration, it is by chance and moment, because we always advanced isolateda little in our corner, inspiring to us by electronics.</tt></b><p><b><tt>You do not have any link with the generation of the acid house?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Not Actually, at that time, at the beginning of the Nineties,we recorded a music with the vocal ones and guitars, very influenced bygroups of experimental and atmospheric music like My Bloody Valentine.They are only front and after the explosion of the acid house, in completeshift, that we were perhaps close to the movement...</tt></b><p><b><tt>Finally, why then you returned to electronics?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - It was more natural for us... We worked always much, polishingour music unceasingly, even when they sounded more acoustic or guitar.For one month, two months, one reconsiders our pieces, changing a soundhere, by adding another... One sample ourselves unceasingly, to returnto a sound almost exclusively electronic, it was simply to go until theend of our logic.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Was this sampler appropriateness thanks to the new technologicaltools, that you did not have at your beginnings, one of the reasons ofyour return to electronics?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yeah... This technology enabled us to simplify our step.With the sampler, you have the absolute control of your music. You cantake the sound of an instrument, and make it sound with your own way withblows of going return. An example: on our last album, there are titlesfor which we used a piano. Thanks to the sampling, we transformed the soundof this piano of full in different ways, at the point to make it soundlike one very very old piano, or so much so that anybody realisedoes notrealise by listening to the album that there is piano. Also voices thesame. Even topo for the guitars. We played of electric or acoustic instrumentsfor " Music Has The Right To Children ", but we completely worked overagain their sound thanks to electronics.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Why these childish melodies on your album, from where that comedoes?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - One finds there the echo of the melodies which marked ourchildhood, and these melodies, for the majority, come from tele, and inparticular from films and childish emissions. In fact the universe markedour generation. We have all the same age. We grew by seeing the same programsTV, and it is for us an influence much stronger than the musics of todayor than of other musics that we listen at the time. These are the airswhich remain in our heads, that one wants it or not.</tt></b><p><b><tt>You are very nostalgic of your childhood?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yeah... Under a very experimental surface, very minimaland industrial, one perceives echoes of this nostalgia, tele programs whichmarked childhood. And I believe it will go further in this direction. Itis a natural process of creation. One invents starting from the tracesof his memory as much as starting from his desires.</tt></b><p><b><tt>You use samples of programs TV?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - No. All the melodies which sound as samples are made byus, then destroyed by the sampling.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Sometimes, by listening to the album, there is the impressionto hear songs of birds, noises of nature... They are not samples?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Some. It is a great influence, it is right which natureinfluences us, all like the open windows of the studio (laughter). It isfor this reason, " Rue The Whirl ", on the album, where one intends birdsto sing. In fact, I listened to this piece, and, oddly, I perceived noisesof birds. It be there that I me be realize that the window be open, andas these song himself marry with wonder with the music, we them have recordto find the impression feel in listen to the title with the window open.</tt></b><p><b><tt>At the beginning of the interview, you spoke about your friendsand of your family around you, act does of a community of artists? Studentsin history of art?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Some of our friends are students in history of art, orprofessors of modern art some are artists, others are only enthusiasticfriends. One finds there photographers, film realizers, artists and musicians...And then much of friends whom we kept from the school. When we were atthe school, all our friends were in groups of rock'n'roll, we were theonly ones to make electronics. At that time, we started to make films,vid&eacute;os in addition to the music... One produced work of some ofour friends, who they are expos or documentary...</tt></b><p><b><tt>You carry out vid&eacute;os in the same spirit as your music?It is not video high tech?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, completely. It is a little Do It Yourself video, exceptthat we do not use badly a equipment high tech. One likes to degrade thephoto or video images as one degrades the sound, to make the images harder,primary, dirty... One tests corrompre technology.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Does that sometimes happen to you to create of a same dash musicand images? To think your music in images?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, of course, but in a natural and intuitive way morethan calculated. The most shifted musicians electronic like that theirmusic sounds kinematic, i.e. in images. It is an all the more easy stepfor the musicians that do not think systematically of the clubs when theycreate a title... If one can dance on one of our titles, it is perfect,but we do not seek it. We leave ourselves any freedom, with the objectiveto translate emotions rather than to make dance. There are heaps of peoplewho do that so much better than us.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Why put us at it to us also by doing it less better? There arehowever pieces which would go well in club on the album... It is well.Admittedly, we work the rates/rhythms, but for us it is about a vehiclefor the beautiful ones and strange melodies. We try to vary the effects,and it is all the more significant for the scene. In addition, we likethe supported rates/rhythms, almost binary, because they stick well toour desire to create dark and obsessional atmospheres to marry them withour melodies.</tt></b><p><b><tt>One finds this duality in a title like " An Eagle In Your Mind"... It is exactly that. On a side of the melodies and almost naive voices,other, a process of corruption of these voices and melodies, by an environmentor transformations, as in the title which you quote or " Sixtyten "...One does not wish to go towards rates/rhythms like those of the drum'n'bass,which, by their ambition and their complexity, can foutre in the air thistype of effect and the emotion turbid and ambiguous that we wish to create.The rate/rhythm must remain simple. It is a question of balance.</tt></b><p><b><tt>In do concert, you try to mix its and image, as if they wereanswered one the other?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Not, not yet. Admittedly, we may try to marry image andsound. We try to create the visual ones who stick to the music, but withinthe limit of the technical possibilities... We were very influenced bya group which is called Test Department, in the eighties, which playedmuch with the images and the sounds, and which did not have anything tomake dance or the pop one like much of artists of the time. They alwaysfollowed their way, without worrying about the mode.</tt></b><p><b><tt>A group like Test Department, even if it could make dance, contrefoutaitrate/rhythm of the time. They were very strong, in particular on scene,because they did not resemble anybody. They made industrial music, butwith the occasion mixed with it with the Celtic influences or the rates/rhythmsto be danced... They showed us that one could survive and respected bycarrying out his own way, without trying to copy the style of the others.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Is your concerts are very well prepared, or there a place forthe improvisation, in particular by the image?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - One cannot easy improvise with the image. It is an objectivebut it is very hard. One will start to use computers to advance on thisway, using computer video, in order to treat the video clips like sourcesof samples image. Today, on scene, one cannot easy play with the videolike one does it with the vinyls. There is an element of chance nevertheless.We do not want that a show is perfect, because we do not like the perfection.We wish that there be chaos in a spectacle or a music, hardness, surprises...That returns more all exciting...</tt></b><p><b><tt>Is your large studio in a small city?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - It is in the countryside, with some houses, with milesof Edimbourgh. It is not a very large studio, but it is full with maths...</tt></b><p><b><tt>It is a kind of community?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - A group of friends. Each one with its family...</tt></b><p><b><tt>In cities like Glasgow or Edinburgh, there is a very active artisticscene, in art, video and electronic music of course, with very young artists,festivals, etc, of it are you close?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - It occurs there from the things formidable, impossibleto follow all. Never there were as many places and initiatives for theexperimental music, and, more largely, for all the daring artistic initiatives.There shows of video with Internet for example, of the videos mix intolive, of the very odd heap of tricks implying the public... There is alsoa very rich atmosphere electronic, as there were not some before...</tt></b><p><b><tt>All the voices which you do use are those of friends?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, for the majority. It is one mix of things. One usesfor example cassettes which we had recorded ten years ago, that one listensto like that, and which one uses a word. One lets oneself go to the rediscoverieschance.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Do the theories of Sciences interest you? Sciences a little barjes?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yeah. I do not know from where that comes, but strangesciences always impassioned us, and numbers... that influences what wedo. Me, they are rather the numbers and their form, and psychologies. Iwas always impassioned reports/ratios of the music and numbers. The psychedelicexperiment goes in this direction, it can help us to see the things interms of numbers and forms, of structures, as if the music were made crystals.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Does that influence you? It is an aspect of your universe?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - One does not say oneself, hold, there in fact the artificialswill influence us. Not, these strange sciences form part of our universe,and one finds it in our music. Not science fiction, but these scienceswhich concretize today visions of the SF of the past. We grew in the seventies,at one time of great paranoia compared to sciences, paranoia which onefound in the science fiction of the time, in the books as in films. Itis this paranoia, this pessimism, this fear of the science which one findsin our music as well as other influences. At the time when we grew in theseventies, the vision of the future which showed through with tele or infilms was very bleak, and very strong.</tt></b><p><b><tt>You also spoke about psychedelism?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, we plunged in art and the psychedelics at one time.One r&eacute;&eacute;coute often of the groups of the end of the sixties...</tt></b><p><b><tt>" Good Vibrations "?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - Yes, exactly this kind of things, Beach Boys of the time" Good Vibrations ", the numbers, secret in Beatles of 1967. For us, Beatlesreally became enthralling with the psychedelism. Or of the film tricksinspired, or if not Incredible String Band...</tt></b><p><b><tt>How did you come into contact with Skam Records?</tt></b><p><b><tt>BOC - We made an album, a EP. One sent it to some people, ofwhich Sean Booth d' Autechre. The shortly after the day when it receivedit, Sean us called, and said to us that us must do something with Skam.One gave them a title for a compilation, an EP, and the last year one startedto work on an album for Skam. About September, we also sympathized withpeople of Warp. They said to us that they also wanted this album, but withoutpricking it in Skam, this is why the album comes out with the double labelSkam and Warp.</tt></b><p><b><tt>Remarks collected by Ariel Kyrou and Jean-Yves Leloup, ParisJuin 1998</tt></b><p><b><tt>Photograph: PIC.</tt></b><br>&nbsp;</blockquote></body></html>
